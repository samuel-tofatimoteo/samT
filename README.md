# Sam | Web devolper 

## Talofa üëã

I am Web developer always looking for a new opportunity to grow.

I'm a pasifika individual from a 9-5 warehousing background, diving into a new found passion for problem-solving and searching new ideas through programming.
I recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I learnt to build fullstack software applications in a simulated Agile work environment.

Here you will find me using my coding skills to help myself and others. But mostly sharpening my craft üë®‚Äçüíª
